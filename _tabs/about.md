> # ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm Spencer (aka SCipher), a techie and full time tinkerer at heart. I'm trying my hand at sharing my own tech journey through this site. I enjoy the ever-changing way technology can be used both personally and professionally to enhance our lives.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve followed a wide range of individuals, communities, and organizations across social platforms that have played a big role in shaping my own development. This site is my way of giving back. I truly believe in the power of sharing knowledgeâ€”whether itâ€™s with my team, clients, or others in the industryâ€”because it helps us all grow together. My hope is that this becomes a space for ongoing learning and mutual growth, both for myself and for anyone who connects with it.

The following is just some of the wide range of topics I hope to discuss and cover.

* Try Hack me and other Hacking challenges that I learn from.
* HomeLab
* DevOps
* Artificial Intelligence
* Modern Work + Security <i>(some more work related content)</i>
