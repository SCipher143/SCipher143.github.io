description: Build your KQL skills in the KC7 Cyber Challenge by working through real-world threat hunting scenarios. Master the basics of querying with KQL and learn how to pivot through logs to uncover suspicious activity.
---

## üîç Overview

The **KQL 101** section is the first part of the [KC7 Cyber Challenge Module 132](https://kc7cyber.com/challenges/132), introducing foundational concepts for querying logs with **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**. This module sets the stage for the rest of the challenge, walking you through how to investigate events using real-world log formats.

### üìö Module Structure

This challenge is divided into four parts:
1. **KQL 101** *(This write-up focuses here)*
2. Welcome to Valdoria!
3. Plenty of Phish
4. A Scandal

Each section builds on the last. For example, you may uncover an IP address or user account in one task that becomes the key to solving several others.

### üõ†Ô∏è Skills Practiced

- Writing basic and advanced **KQL queries**
- Using tables like `SigninLogs`, `DeviceLogonEvents`, etc.
- Filtering and projecting fields
- Pivoting on IoCs (IP addresses, usernames, hostnames)
- Log correlation and event tracing

### üß™ What You'll Learn

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
- Query effectively in Microsoft Sentinel
- Identify suspicious logon behavior
- Track user and device activity through logs
- Use summarization and visualization techniques for analysis

### ‚úÖ Completion Notes

The **KQL 101** section is a great primer for new threat hunters or SOC analysts looking to sharpen their detection and log analysis skills in a Microsoft ecosystem. Everything learned here plays a role in uncovering deeper threats in the upcoming sections of the challenge.

## Intro: Welcome to Valdoria!

On the eve of the election, Nene Leaks, the esteemed editor of The Valdorian Times, awoke to a nightmare. The Valdorian Times, the beacon of truth for the city, published a scandalous article accusing Luffy of corruption and misconduct. The article, a vile concoction of lies, was not what she had approved.

The article alleged that Luffy, hailed for his environmental activism and social reforms, was secretly involved in a land deal scandal, exploiting his position to benefit a shadowy network of real estate moguls. Furthermore, it accused Luffy of accepting substantial bribes to push environmentally damaging policies, a stark contradiction to his public persona.

However, the article, a vile concoction of lies, was not what had been approved by the newspaper's editor üòµ.

The Valdorian Times has hired you as a cyber incident responder to help investigate the incident and get to the bottom of how the falsified article was published.

### Run a take 10 on each of the tables to see what kind of data they contain.

Now that we have access to the data, we'll need to get a lay of the land. Let's get some more information about the Valdorian Times.

### How many employees work at the Valdorian Times?

We can use the where operator with the Employees table to find a specific employee.

Here is a template you can follow:

```KQL
Table
| where <field> <operator> <value>
```

### What is the Editorial Director's name?

We can learn more about Nene Leaks using information from other tables. Let's take her email address from the Employees table and use it in a query for the Email table.

### How many emails did Nene Leaks receive?
