## Home Lab Overview 

- **pfSense** – Gateway and firewall for managing network traffic and segmentation.

- **Kali Linux** – Management VM with tools for penetration testing and administration.

- **Metasploit & Chronos** – Used for exploit development and time-based attack simulations.

- **Malware Analysis Lab** – Isolated environment with Windows and Linux VMs for analyzing malware samples.

- **Security VMs**

 - **DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)** – Using tools like Tsurugi Linux.

 - **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** – Powered by Splunk for log aggregation and analysis.

- **Windows Server** – Configured with Active Directory for enterprise-like domain management and authentication scenarios.

- **Cyber Range** – Collection of vulnerable VMs (e.g., FLARE VM, REMnux) for CTF practice and reverse engineering.

> `Before Starting`
pfSense is basically the core of the whole lab — it's the router and firewall that everything else connects through. Make sure it's the first VM you boot up whenever you're starting the lab. If it's not running, none of the other VMs will be able to reach the internet or talk to each other. Once pfSense is online, you can start spinning up the rest.
