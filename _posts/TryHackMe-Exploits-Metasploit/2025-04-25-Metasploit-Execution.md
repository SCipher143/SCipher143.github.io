# Metasploit Practice

### Lab from THM Metasploit: Exploitation

**Our IP: 10.10.X.X**
**Target IP: 10.10.21.251**

#### **Scanning**

**How many ports are on the target system?**

First we boot up **msfconsole** then for **reconnaissance** we could either use **nmap** or a built in scanner in Metasploit. For this istance we will the built in one. 

Second if we don't know one we can search for one like so:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/THM-Metasploit/THM-8.png){: width="700" height="400" }

After using the **search** command specifying a **portscan** and **tcp** we then can choose one with the **use (number)** command. Then **show options** **set** any options and **run/exploit** the target like so:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/THM-Metasploit/THM-9.png){: width="700" height="400" }

Ports that can be vulnerable- 21, 139, 445, 8000

### Questions

**Using the relevant scanner, what NetBIOS name can you see?**

**search** netbios then pick the correct scanner set options and run it.

Answer = ACME IT SUPPORT

**What is running on port 8000?**

![Desktop View](/assets/img/THM-Metasploit/THM-11.png){: width="700" height="400" }

Answer = webfs/1.21

**What is the "penny" user's SMB password? Use the wordlist mentioned in the previous task.**

![Desktop View](/assets/img/THM-Metasploit/THM-12.png){: width="700" height="400" }

Running the uxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login and setting the sbuser as penny and using the provided password file list we uncover their password as leo1234

#### **The Metasploit Database**

"Metasploit has a database function to simplify project management and avoid possible confusion when setting up parameter values." 

You will first need to start the PostgreSQL database, which Metasploit will use with the following command: systemctl start postgresql.

Then you will need to initialize the Metasploit Database using the msfdb init command. However, trying to run msfdb init as root will give the following error message, "Please run msfdb as a non-root user." This can be solved by running it as the postgres account using sudo -u postgres msfdb init.

### **Important**

You may want to look for low-hanging fruits such as:

HTTP: Could potentially host a web application where you can find vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Remote Code Execution (RCE).
FTP: Could allow anonymous login and provide access to interesting files.
SMB: Could be vulnerable to SMB exploits like MS17-010
SSH: Could have default or easy to guess credentials
RDP: Could be vulnerable to Bluekeep or allow desktop access if weak credentials were used.
