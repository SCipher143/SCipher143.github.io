# Metasploit Practice

### Lab from THM Metasploit: Exploitation

**Our IP: 10.10.X.X**
**Target IP: 10.10.21.251**

**How many ports are on the target system?**

First we boot up **msfconsole** then for **reconnaissance** we could either use **nmap** or a built in scanner in Metasploit. For this istance we will the built in one. 

Second if we don't know one we can search for one like so:

After using the **search** command specifying a **portscan** and **tcp** we then can choose one with the **use (number)** command. Then **show options** **set** any options and **run/exploit** the target like so:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/THM-Metasploit/THM-9.png){: width="700" height="400" }

Ports that can be vulnerable- 21, 139, 445, 8000

### Questions

**Using the relevant scanner, what NetBIOS name can you see?**

**search** netbios then pick the correct scanner set options and run it.

**What is the "penny" user's SMB password? Use the wordlist mentioned in the previous task.**

Running the uxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login and setting the sbuser as penny and using the provided password file list we uncover their password as leo1234
