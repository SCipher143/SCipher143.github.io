description: Investigate suspicious activity using Splunk in this TryHackMe room. Learn how to analyze logs, detect anomalies, and uncover attacker behavior in a realistic SOC environment.

His manager has asked him to pull those logs from suspected hosts and ingest them into Splunk for quick investigation. Our task as SOC Analyst is to examine the logs and identify the anomalies.
