## Scenario: Identify and Investigate an Infected Host

### Incident Overview

One of the client’s **IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)** indicated a potentially suspicious process execution, suggesting that one of the hosts from the **HR department** was compromised. Tools related to **network information gathering** and **scheduled tasks** were executed, confirming the suspicion.

Due to limited resources, only **process execution logs (Event ID: 4688)** were pulled and ingested into **Splunk** using the index `win_eventlogs` for further investigation.

### Network Segmentation

Understanding the network layout is essential for the investigation. The network is logically divided into the following segments:

**IT Department**
- James  
- Moin  
- Katrina  

**HR Department**
- Haroon  
- Chris  
- Diana  

**Marketing Department**
- Bell  
- Amelia  
- Deepak
