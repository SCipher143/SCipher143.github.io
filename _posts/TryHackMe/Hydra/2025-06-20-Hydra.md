## Hydra Intro
Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program, a quick system login password “hacking” tool.

Hydra can run through a list and “brute force” some authentication services. Imagine trying to manually guess someone’s password on a particular service (SSH, Web Application Form, FTP or SNMP) - we can use Hydra to run through a password list and speed this process up for us, determining the correct password.

According to its [official repository](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra), Hydra supports, i.e., has the ability to brute force the following protocols: “Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP, HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY, HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST, HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MEMCACHED, MONGODB, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, Radmin, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, TeamSpeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.”

For more information on the options of each protocol in Hydra, you can check the [Hydra tool page](https://en.kali.tools/?p=220Kali).

This shows the importance of using a strong password; if your password is common, doesn’t contain special characters and is not above eight characters, it will be prone to be guessed. A one-hundred-million-password list contains common passwords, so when an out-of-the-box application uses an easy password to log in, change it from the default! CCTV cameras and web frameworks often use `admin:password` as the default login credentials, which is obviously not strong enough.

## Using Hydra 

#### Hydra Commands

The options we pass into Hydra depend on which service (protocol) we’re attacking. For example, if we wanted to brute force FTP with the username being user and a password list being `passlist.txt`, we’d use the following command:

`hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://10.10.248.143`

For this deployed machine, here are the commands to use Hydra on SSH and a web form (POST method).

#### SSH

`hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> 10.10.248.143 -t 4 ssh`

| Option | Description                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `-l`   | Specifies the (SSH) username for login |
| `-P`   | Indicates a list of passwords          |
| `-t`   | Sets the number of threads to spawn    |

For example, `hydra -l root -P passwords.txt 10.10.248.143 -t 4 ssh` will run with the following arguments:

- Hydra will use `root` as the username for `ssh`

- It will try the passwords in the `passwords.txt` file

- There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by `-t 4`

#### Post Web Form

We can use Hydra to brute force web forms too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browser’s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.

`sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> 10.10.248.143 http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"`

| Option                | Description                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-l`                  | The username for (web form) login                                                       |
| `-P`                  | The password list to use                                                                |
| `http-post-form`      | Specifies that the form method is POST                                                  |
| `<path>`              | The login page URL (e.g., `login.php`)                                                  |
| `<login_credentials>` | The POST data format using Hydra placeholders (e.g., `username=^USER^&password=^PASS^`) |
| `<invalid_response>`  | A string found in the response when login fails (e.g., `Invalid password`)              |
| `-V`                  | Verbose output for every login attempt                                                  |

Below is a more concrete example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:

`hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.10.248.143 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V`

- The login page is only /, i.e., the main IP address.

- The username is the form field where the username is entered

- The specified username(s) will replace ^USER^

- The password is the form field where the password is entered

- The provided passwords will be replacing ^PASS^

- Finally, F=incorrect is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails

### Challenge
