Using research or knowledge we know SMB Version 1 is vulnerable to MS17-010.

##### Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)

We then set this paylaod **set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp** and run the exploit

##### Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use?

First we backround the current session. Then we would run this module: **post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter**

##### Show options, what option are we required to change?

SESSION

##### Verify that we have escalated to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Run getsystem to confirm this. Feel free to open a dos shell via the command 'shell' and run 'whoami'. This should return that we are indeed system. Background this shell afterwards and select our meterpreter session for usage again.

Backrounding our shell and using the ps command in meterpreter. We notice the lsass.exe is PID 704

In case we didn't know where passwords were stored we could use the search -f command
